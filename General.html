			<p><div class="scroll">When Nintendo released The Legend of Zelda for the Japanese market in 1986, it marked a new era in the culture, technology, and business of video games. The game’s designer, Miyamoto Shigeru, was already a star, having produced Donkey Kong and the Mario Brothers series. Now he wanted to push further the concept of open-ended game play by giving players a large but unified world in which they could discover their own path for the development of the main character, named Link. Miyamoto’s design exploited the improvements in graphics processing made possible by Nintendo’s MMC (Memory Map Controller) chip, and the provision of battery-powered backup storage in Nintendo’s new game cartridges allowed players to save their progress, thus making extended story lines more practical. The game interface also featured new elements, such as screens that were activated to manage the hero’s items or abilities—a technique similar to the pull-down menus then beginning to appear in business software. These innovations gave players freedom to navigate through a fully two-dimensional world (viewed from the top down) as Link’s personality evolved through his efforts to defeat the evil Ganon and rescue princess Zelda. Moreover, Miyamoto paid careful attention to the pacing and complexity of the game, ensuring that players would improve their skills as Link progressed to more difficult challenges. Success in The Legend of Zelda was measured by playing the game to completion over multiple sessions lasting perhaps dozens of hours, rather than scoring as many points as possible in a single session. Miyamoto thus raised expectations for greater narrative scope and more compelling game mechanics in a new generation of video games.</div></p>
